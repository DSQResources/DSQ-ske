# Do you need to create vocabularies or ontologies for any of your data items?

*[Data Stewardship Wizard] Question - additional resources*

Short UID: ske

## The Question

For good interoperability the use of controlled vocabularies for each discrete data item is advisable. If such vocabularies exist, it is best to reuse those.

### Possible answers:

  * No, suitable public controlled vocabularies or ontologies exist for all of my data types 
  * Yes, I will make and publish a vocabulary or ontology for some of my data
